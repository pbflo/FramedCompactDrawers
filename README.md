# FramedCompactDrawers - Compat
This is an addon mod to [Storage Drawers](https://www.curseforge.com/Minecraft/mc-mods/storage-drawers) and [Compact Drawers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compactdrawers) that adds frameable versions of the 2 Slot Compacting Drawer, 2 Slot Half Compacting Drawer and 3 Slot Half Compacting Drawer. Much like the other framed drawers, the front, sides and trim (or top/bottom, sides and trim for the Controller Slave) can be retextured to any block using the framing table. It is an extension of the [Framed Compacting Drawers Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/framed-compacting-drawers) by Eutropium.
